Description of the flow

===== STARTUP =====
1. User starts the application
2. Application reads configuration file
3. User ID is required/assigned if not in the configuration file

--> FORK

4. Server starts accepting connections
5. Client prompts for connection

===== INITIATE CALL =====
1. User types in the server name or IP address
2. Application tries to connect
3. Upon success, prompts the user to enter message
4. Upon failure, prompts the user for other connection

===== RECEIVE CALL =====
1. The server prompts the user for the incoming call, showing caller's
ID
2. User accepts the call
3. Server receives a message from the caller and shows it
4. Application prompts user for response

===== CALL WHILE IN A SESSION =====
1. The user is making a chat session and wants to invite someone else
2. type the escape character '\' and the command 'call <address>'
3. This creates a new session, if the other end accepts
4. When a message is typed in by any of the connected ends, it is
broadcasted to the others. This means that if an end has multiple
connections, it has to broadcast the message too the others
5. There must be a top-level in each end, aware of all the connections
and responsible for the broadcasting activity.
